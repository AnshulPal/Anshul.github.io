# 1. Process and Network Monitoring 📊

This Python script logs detailed process and network connection information and saves the collected data into a well-structured CSV file on your desktop for thorough analysis.

## Features 🔄
- Logs process details including PID, CPU/memory usage, privileges, and parent process information
- Tracks associated network connections: IP addresses, ports, and statuses
- Monitors active processes and logs their start and end times accurately
- Outputs all collected data into an easy-to-analyze CSV format

## Requirements 📅
- **OS**: Windows
- **Python**: 3.6+
- **Libraries**: `psutil`, `wmi`

## Installation 🔧
```bash
pip install psutil wmi
```

## Running the Script 📗
1. Open `process_network_logger.py`
2. Modify the monitoring duration if needed
3. Run:
```bash
python 1process_and_network_monitoring.py
```
4. Find the output file: `full_process_network_info.csv` on your desktop

## How It Works 📊
- **Privilege Detection**: Uses Windows APIs (admin rights needed)
- **Network Connection Retrieval**: Utilizes `psutil`
- **Data Collection**: Captures CPU, memory, I/O, runtime, and privileges
- **Output**: Detailed CSV export for complete visibility

2. Run:
```bash
python process_chain_tracker.py
```
3. Press `Ctrl+C` anytime to stop and display the tracked tree

## Example Output 👁️
```
Process 'Code.exe' (PID: 1234) detected.
    Process 'ChildProcess1.exe' (PID: 5678)
        Process 'GrandChildProcess.exe' (PID: 91011)
